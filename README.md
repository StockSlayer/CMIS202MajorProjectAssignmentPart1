--Market Finance Portfolio--
Who: This software is for first time investors.
What: The purpose of this software is to allow first time investors to keep track of their investments in their portfolio.
Where & When: This hopefully can be used  anywhere. Especially when a question arises about an investment, they can access their account and find the answer.
How: My plan is still in the works, but this is manly a market calculator. 
Allowing a user to punch in date and calculate a number and store it to a file. 
For example, a stock has historical data that provides a ser with a 
open, close, volume, previous day close, quarterly data,  annual data, etc..
and from this you can calculate the net change, daily percent change, quarterly percent change, year to date change.
From this data you can calculate investment performance for a portfolio. 
Calculate Return on Investment (ROI):
ROI= (FVI−IVI / Cost of Investment)×100  where: FVI=Final value of investment & IVI=Initial value of investment.
future value = present value x (1+ interest rate)^n
Dividends: Annual net income - net change in retained earnings = dividends paid.
Expected portfolio return = (Asset 1 Weight x Expected Return) + (Asset 2 Weight x Expected Return)...
Asset	Weight    Expected Return
A	     35%	        6%
B	     25%	        7%
C	     40%	       10%
 (35% x 6%) + (25% x 7%) + (40% x 10%) = 7.85%
Annualized ROI=[(1+ROI)^(1/n) −1]×100%
where: n=Number of years investment is held.
Comparing Investments and Annualized ROI:
AROIx =[(1+0.50)^(1/5) −1]×100 = 8.45%
AROIy =[(1+0.30)^(1/3) −1]×100 = 9.14%
where: AROIx = Annualized ROI for stock X, AROIy = Annualized ROI for stock Y.
Also, another big part of the market are bonds. Calculating a bonds return, For example  
By using the bonds interest rate on the day of purchase. 
You can calculate the monthly return rate and use that to find the total return based on the number of years you hold the bond. 
Why: I think hopefully new investors who see the current data, graphs, etc... find it confusing at least.I did when I first started. 
Plus, not everyone can find or afford a good financial adviser who can  teach you about the market and have your best interest in mind. 
If you have a simple software that allows you to input and save data on your investment -
whether that be bonds or stocks, index funds, commodities, ETFs, or anything else and calculate numbers -
that can give you a better understanding of how your investment are progressing it may be worth trying.
